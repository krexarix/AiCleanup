For the purposes of this Policy, "personal data" refers to all data that identifies you or that could be used to identify you.

2.1. Local Processing (On-Device) Crucial Note: To protect your privacy, our App is designed to process your sensitive media files (photos, videos, contacts) locally on your device.

The categorization (blur detection, duplicate finding, AI analysis) happens directly on your smartphone using on-device technology (e.g., Apple CoreML).

2.2. Data we may access (with your permission):

Media Library: Access to your camera roll to identify duplicates, screenshots, and blurred photos. This data remains on your device.

Email Access: If you use the email cleaning feature, you grant the App permission to access your email metadata (headers) and content via IMAP or API connections directly between your device and your email provider. We do not store your emails on our servers.

Device Information: Technical data such as device model, OS version, language, and time zone. This is used for app functionality and debugging (Crashlytics).

Usage Data: Information about how you use the App (e.g., screens visited, buttons clicked). This is collected anonymously to improve the user experience.

Purchase History: Information regarding your subscription status (via RevenueCat/Apple/Google). We do not have access to your credit card details.

The App’s use of information received from Google APIs will adhere to the Google User Data Policy, including the Limited Use requirements.
